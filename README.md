# Malware-Detection-using-ML-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques
contains 5 models of machine leaning and deep learning to detect malware file
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, SVM, Neural Network
first collected the mentioned dataset then 
split the dataset into test and train dataset 
then calculating test data Accuracy, train data Accuracy, F1_Score and Confusion matrix for each model
